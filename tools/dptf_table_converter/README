dptfxtract

This tool converts tables used on some platforms using
"Intel ® Dynamic Platform and Thermal Framework (Intel® DPTF)"
to thermal_conf.xml format whenever possible.

This requires root privileges to run this tool. This tool will copy
converted files to /var/run/thermald/ folder. This is the default
folder for thermald to pickup auto generated configuration file using
ACPI tables.

Refer to COPYING file for the license information.
